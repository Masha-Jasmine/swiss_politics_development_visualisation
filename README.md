# swiss_politics_development_visualisation

In this project a web page was created for visualizing and exploring the development of Swiss political dynamics using various charts and visualizations. 
It includes components such as a Swiss map displaying political parties by color, stacked area charts, radar charts, bar plots, and multiple area charts. 
The page aims to provide insights into the results of cantonal parliamentary elections between 1972 and 2021, allowing users to interact and explore the data in different ways.
